# Night-In-The-Museum - Udacity Nanodegree 

## Statement of Purpose
> "Night at the museum is a mobile VR experience for users who want to learn more about the future of VR in an interactive fashion"

## Requirements
Prior to starting this project, I was instructed to do research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. After conducting my research, the goal was to create 
a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. These booths are to showcase 
my findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. 
Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the 
information about my research. Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

## Results
The VR industry is a rapidly evolving landscape and as such, I wanted to focus on the bigger picture rather than a particular company/technology. The notion of having five display points sparked an idea which lead me to research a VR technology. I researched about Microsoft hololense mixed reality platfrom and presented my findings in the VR experince.  

# Google VR SDK Version
GVR Unity SDK v1.60.0

# Unity version
Unity 2017.1.0p4

# Scene Location
The main scene can be found at Assets/Udacity/Scenes

## Final Thoughts
This was the first time I had the opportunity to build an entire mobile VR application from scratch, and as such, hit many roadblocks. Completing this project in a timely mannor
was a testiment to my dedication and organizational skills. I can't wait to continue on and complete the specializations within the nanodegree.
